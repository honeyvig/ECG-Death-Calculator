Explanation of the Code

    Setup: The application initializes a PyQt window with input fields for ECG parameters and a button to trigger the prediction.

    Dummy Model: A simple logistic regression model is created for demonstration. In practice, you would replace this with a trained model based on ECG data.

    Input Handling: The user inputs comma-separated ECG parameters, which are parsed and used for making predictions.

    Prediction: The model predicts the risk based on the input data, and the result is displayed in the GUI.

Running the Application

    Save the code in a file named ecg_risk_estimator.py.
    Run the script using Python:

bash

python ecg_risk_estimator.py

Note

    This code is a basic structure and lacks the actual ECG data processing and model training.
    You will need to implement your model using real ECG data and improve the UI/UX for better usability.
